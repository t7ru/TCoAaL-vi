# Clean CGs FAQs
## How do I open PDN files?
You need to install Paint.net, you can find it [here](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html).

## What is the difference between PDN and PNG?
PDN files has layers which can be moved meaning you can put text or images under an another image. Ground20 is a good example of this.

PNG are fixed, they don't have layers.

## Do I have to credit you?
No, of course not! I don't own these images, I merely just edited them out. Sharing this repository should be done out of good will instead of being necessary.
